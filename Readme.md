# Socket Conveyor

This package enables you to work with socket messages using routing strategy. For that, you just add an Action Handler implementing the `ActionInterface` to the `SocketMessageRouter` and watch the magic happen!

As an example of how to accomplish that with PHP, you can use the [OpenSwoole](https://openswoole.com/). You can find out more how to use WebSockets with OpenSwoole [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vgw5Ibqc15k).

Built for PHP8.0+.

See more at the [Documentation](https://socketconveyor.com).
